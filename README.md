# Symphony-Celebration-SQL-Certification

The New York Philharmonic is one of America's largest orchestras. In honor of its many famous musicians, the director is planning a special event. She wants to hold a concert to celebrate the top soloists from its history. You have been asked to determine which soloists should receive recognition.

The director has given you the following requirements:

- The results should only include the top 1% of soloists calculated by the total number of concerts performed.

- Limit your results to entries where the orchestra is 'New York Philharmonic' and the event type is 'Subscription Season'. Soloist performances in other orchestras or event types should not count towards the calculation of the top soloists.

- The director is only interested in individual soloists. You will need to exclude all of the following soloists: 'Chorus', 'No Soloist', 'New York Choral Artists', and 'Schola Cantorum of NY'. You should also exclude any soloist with 'choir' in the name.


In this project I have used my SQL skill to do the data analysis and find the ouput as per the problem was given.
